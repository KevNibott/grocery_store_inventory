# grocery_store_inventory
A functional app to create/navigate through an inventory database using SQLAlchemy

  * When the app is runned, it creates a database from a given .csv file with a particular format (brands.csv and inventory.csv).
  * Once the database is created, it won't be created again unless the database file is deleted.
  * A main menu will appear with all the options possible to navigate through the database information.
  * You can add new entries, edit them, delete them, check them or make a backup .csv file.
